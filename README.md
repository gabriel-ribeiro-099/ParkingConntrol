# Parking Control System

This system is built using Spring Boot and Spring JPA, I'm using PostgreSQL as my DB.

The system simulates the parking control of a building, in this building each apartment has only one parking spot. The provides the options to create a parking spot, with a car, responsible, apartment, and other, delete a signup spot, read all the spots or read only one with X ID, or update the information about that spot

I did this while watching a YouTube video of Michelli Brito
